EXPECTED CTR BY PLATFORM:
- Google Ads: 2.5% - 5.0% (high intent, search-based)
- Meta: 1.5% - 3.5% (social discovery)
- LinkedIn: 1.0% - 2.0% (B2B, niche audience)

DATA QUALITY ISSUES (You MUST Fix These!):
------------------------------------------
❌ DATE FORMATS ARE MIXED:
   - Some: "2024-11-01" (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Some: "01/11/2024" (DD/MM/YYYY)
   - Some: "11-01-2024" (MM-DD-YYYY)
   → You need to standardize to proper Date type!

❌ Ad_Spend HAS CURRENCY SYMBOL:
   - Some: 3293.17 (clean number)
   - Some: "₹3293.17" (text with symbol)
   → Remove ₹ symbol and convert to Decimal!

❌ MISSING VALUES:
   - ~15 rows have NULL in Impressions, Clicks, or Ad_Spend
   → Decide: Remove rows or impute?

❌ NEGATIVE CLICKS:
   - 3 rows have negative Clicks values (data entry error!)
   → Filter out or fix to 0

❌ DUPLICATE ROWS:
   - 10 rows are duplicates (same Campaign_ID + Date)
   → Remove duplicates!

HIDDEN BUSINESS PATTERNS (Your Job to Discover!):
-------------------------------------------------
🔍 WEEKEND EFFECT:
   Ad_Spend is ~50% HIGHER on Saturdays and Sundays
   → Companies increase budget on weekends

🔍 PLATFORM PERFORMANCE:
   - Google Ads: Highest CTR, most expensive
   - Meta: Medium CTR, medium cost
   - LinkedIn: Lowest CTR, expensive per click (B2B premium)

EXPECTED AFTER CLEANING:
- All dates in Date format
- All Ad_Spend in Decimal format
- No missing values in critical columns
- No negative values
- No duplicates
- ~1,035 clean rows

================================================================================
📁 FILE 3: sales_operations_data.csv
================================================================================
PURPOSE: Fact table containing order/transaction data from the company's
         Shopify store / CRM system. This is where you calculate RTO!

COLUMN DETAILS:
---------------
Order_ID        | Text        | Primary Key - Unique order ID (ORD_10001, ORD_10002...)
Date            | Date/Text   | Order placed date (MESSY: Multiple formats!)
Campaign_ID     | Text        | Foreign Key → which campaign drove this sale
Order_Value     | Decimal/Text| Order amount in ₹ (MESSY: some have ₹ symbol!)
Status          | Category    | Order fulfillment status
RTO_Reason      | Text        | Reason for return (only if Status = RTO)
Shipping_Cost   | Decimal     | Shipping cost in ₹ (company loses this on RTO!)
Customer_City   | Category    | Customer's delivery city
Payment_Method  | Category    | Payment type (COD or Prepaid)

STATUS VALUES (What Happens to Orders):
---------------------------------------
Delivered      → Order successfully delivered to customer ✅
                 Company gets Order_Value revenue
                 
RTO            → Return to Origin (customer refused/rejected) ❌
                 Company LOSES Order_Value + Shipping_Cost
                 This is the BIGGEST metric to track!
                 
Cancelled      → Order cancelled before shipping 🚫
                 No revenue, minimal cost

RTO_REASON VALUES (Why customers refuse orders):
------------------------------------------------
- Customer Refused (didn't want it anymore)
- Wrong Address (couldn't deliver)
- Fake Order (COD fraud)
- Customer Not Reachable (phone off)
- Product Damaged (quality issue)
- Customer Changed Mind (impulse buy regret)

PAYMENT_METHOD IMPACT:
---------------------
COD (Cash on Delivery):
  → Customer pays when order arrives
  → HIGHER RTO RATE (~25-30%)
  → Reason: Easy to refuse, no commitment

Prepaid:
  → Customer already paid online
  → LOWER RTO RATE (~8-12%)
  → Reason: Financial commitment, less likely to refuse

DATA QUALITY ISSUES (Clean This Carefully!):
--------------------------------------------
❌ STATUS HAS INCONSISTENT VALUES:
   - "Delivered" vs "delivered" vs "DELIVERED" vs "Dlvrd" vs "Completed"
   - "RTO" vs "rto" vs "Return to Origin" vs "Returned"
   - "Cancelled" vs "cancelled" vs "CANCELLED" vs "Cancel" vs "Canceled"
   → Standardize to: "Delivered", "RTO", "Cancelled"

❌ DATE FORMATS ARE MIXED:
   - "2024-11-01", "01/11/2024", "01-11-2024"
   → Convert all to Date type

❌ Order_Value HAS CURRENCY:
   - Some: 1250.50
   - Some: "₹ 1250.50"
   - Some: "-₹ 1250.50" (refunds!)
   → Remove ₹ symbol, handle negatives

❌ RTO_Reason FILLED WHEN STATUS = DELIVERED:
   - 10 rows have RTO_Reason even though Status is "Delivered"
   → This is DATA ENTRY ERROR! Replace with NULL

❌ MISSING Campaign_ID:
   - 20 orders have NULL Campaign_ID (attribution failed)
   → Decide: Remove or create "Unknown" campaign?

❌ EXTRA SPACES in Order_ID:
   - " ORD_10001" or "ORD_10001 "
   → Trim spaces!

❌ DUPLICATE ORDERS:
   - 25 orders appear twice (system recorded same order multiple times)
   → Remove duplicates!

❌ NEGATIVE Order_Value:
   - 5 orders have negative values (refunds recorded wrongly)
   → These should be separate refund records, filter out

HIDDEN BUSINESS PATTERNS (THE MONEY INSIGHTS!):
-----------------------------------------------
🔥 THE META TRAP (Most Important Finding!):
   Platform: Meta (Facebook/Instagram)
   - CAC: ₹300-500 (CHEAP! Looks great!)
   - RTO Rate: ~28% (DISASTER! Hidden cost!)
   - Why: Impulse buyers on social media
   - Reality: Cheap CAC but HIGH returns = Not profitable!

💰 THE GOOGLE WIN:
   Platform: Google Ads
   - CAC: ₹800-1,000 (EXPENSIVE! Looks bad!)
   - RTO Rate: ~5% (EXCELLENT! High quality!)
   - Why: High intent search users
   - Reality: Expensive CAC but LOW returns = Actually profitable!

🏢 THE LINKEDIN PREMIUM:
   Platform: LinkedIn
   - CAC: ₹1,500-2,000 (VERY EXPENSIVE!)
   - RTO Rate: ~3% (BEST quality!)
   - Why: B2B, decision-makers
   - Reality: Premium customers, almost no returns

📅 THE WEEKEND CHAOS:
   - Weekends: 50% MORE Ad Spend + 40% MORE RTO
   - Why: Impulse weekend shoppers have buyer's remorse on Monday
   - Action: Maybe reduce weekend spend or target better?

💳 THE COD PROBLEM:
   - COD Orders: ~27% RTO rate
   - Prepaid Orders: ~10% RTO rate
   - Why: COD = no commitment, easy to refuse
   - Action: Incentivize prepaid (discounts, faster delivery)

EXPECTED AFTER CLEANING:
- ~28,790 clean orders (after removing duplicates)
- Standardized Status values
- All dates in Date format
- No RTO_Reason when Status ≠ RTO
- No missing Campaign_ID (or marked as "Unknown")
- No negative values

================================================================================
📊 KEY METRICS YOU'LL CALCULATE (DAX Measures)
================================================================================

BASIC METRICS:
-------------
1. Total Ad Spend = SUM(marketing_data[Ad_Spend])
2. Total Orders = COUNTROWS(sales_operations_data)
3. Delivered Orders = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(sales), Status = "Delivered")
4. RTO Orders = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(sales), Status = "RTO")
5. Cancelled Orders = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(sales), Status = "Cancelled")

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
-------------------
6. RTO% = (RTO Orders / Total Orders) × 100
   → CRITICAL: Lower is better! Target: <15%

7. Total Revenue = CALCULATE(SUM(Order_Value), Status = "Delivered")
   → Only delivered orders generate revenue!

8. Lost Revenue (RTO) = CALCULATE(SUM(Order_Value + Shipping_Cost), Status = "RTO")
   → This is money LOST on returns!

ACQUISITION METRICS:
-------------------
9. CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) = Total Ad Spend / Delivered Orders
   → How much it costs to acquire ONE successful customer

10. Effective CAC = Total Ad Spend / (Total Orders - RTO Orders - Cancelled Orders)
    → More accurate: excludes failed orders

11. ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) = Total Revenue / Total Ad Spend
    → ₹5 ROAS = For every ₹1 spent, got ₹5 back
    → Target: >3.0x minimum

ADVANCED METRICS:
----------------
12. Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Ad Spend - SUM(Shipping_Cost for Delivered)
    → The actual profit after ALL costs

13. Profit Per Order = Net Profit / Delivered Orders

14. Platform Efficiency Score = (ROAS × (1 - RTO%))
    → Combines revenue AND quality

  - Replace "linkedin", "LINKEDIN" → "LinkedIn"
□ Replace NULL in Objective with "Unknown"
□ Replace NULL in Target_CAC with 0 or average
□ Trim Campaign_ID (remove extra spaces)
□ Rename to: DimCampaign

For marketing_data.csv:
□ Fix Date column:
  - Convert all formats to proper Date type
  - Use "Using Locale" if needed
□ Fix Ad_Spend:
  - Replace Values: Remove "₹" symbol
  - Change type to Decimal Number
□ Handle missing values:
  - Remove rows with NULL Impressions/Clicks/Ad_Spend
  - Or replace with 0 (document your decision)
□ Filter out negative Clicks (Clicks >= 0)
□ Remove duplicate rows (same Campaign_ID + Date)
□ Create calculated columns:
  - CTR = (Clicks / Impressions) × 100
  - CPC = Ad_Spend / Clicks
□ Rename to: FactMarketing

For sales_operations_data.csv:
□ Fix Date column (same as marketing)
□ Fix Order_Value:
  - Replace Values: Remove "₹" and spaces

□ Clean RTO_Reason:
  - IF Status = "Delivered" OR "Cancelled" THEN NULL
  - Only keep for Status = "RTO"
□ Trim Order_ID (remove spaces)
□ Handle missing Campaign_ID:
  - Replace NULL → "Unknown" (or remove rows)
□ Remove duplicate Order_IDs
□ Create calculated columns:
  - Order_Category = IF Order_Value > 2000 THEN "Premium" ELSE "Regular"
  - Is_Weekend = IF DayOfWeek(Date) IN {6,7} THEN "Weekend" ELSE "Weekday"
  - Net_Order_Value = Order_Value - Shipping_Cost
□ Rename to: FactSales

PHASE 3: CREATE ADDITIONAL DIMENSIONS
-------------------------------------

================================================================================
🎯 INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS (Use This Dataset in Interviews!)
================================================================================

"In my digital marketing analytics project, I worked with real-world messy
data from an Indian D2C e-commerce company running ads on Meta, Google, and
LinkedIn.

The dataset had typical data quality issues - inconsistent date formats,
currency symbols mixed with numbers, duplicate records, and missing values -
which I cleaned in Power Query following a systematic ETL process.

The most interesting finding was the 'Meta Trap': Meta campaigns had the
lowest CAC at ₹300-500, which looked great on paper, but had a 28% RTO rate
compared to Google's 5%. After calculating effective CAC and factoring in lost
shipping costs, Google Ads was actually MORE profitable despite being more
expensive upfront.

I also discovered that weekend campaigns had 40% higher RTO rates, suggesting
impulse buying behavior, and COD orders had nearly 3x the RTO rate of prepaid.

I built a star schema model with separate fact tables for marketing spend and
sales, created 15+ DAX measures including CAC, ROAS, and platform efficiency
scores, and designed executive dashboards that helped identify which channels
drove profitable growth vs just cheap clicks.

This project taught me that low acquisition cost doesn't always mean high
profitability - you have to factor in customer quality, return rates, and
lifetime value."

================================================================================
🔥 FINAL TIPS FOR SUCCESS
